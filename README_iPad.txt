Compatibility build (v3)
- Adds crypto.randomUUID polyfill for older iPad Safari.
- Visible on-screen error banner if a JS error occurs (to avoid blank page).
- Keeps daily totals (per person), date-range report (per person), and print-friendly report.
- Service worker cache bumped to v7 so it updates after upload.
